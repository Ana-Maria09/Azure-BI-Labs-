🚀 Azure BI Labs - SQL Joins Project
Welcome to my Azure BI Labs project! 🎉 In this repository, I have explored SQL Joins using Azure BI tools to manipulate and analyze data efficiently. 📊🔍

📌 Project Overview
This project is a deep dive into SQL joins using Azure BI Labs. I have utilized various types of joins to fetch and merge data meaningfully. My name has been incorporated into the dataset to personalize the results. 👤✨
